Rainfall plays a critical role in India’s economy by influencing agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. The given dataset spans from 1901 to 2015, which offers a comprehensive view of rainfall patterns across the country. It provides detailed monthly rainfall data, seasonal aggregations, and annual totals. The dataset is structured to include columns for each month (e.g., January to December), seasonal rainfall (e.g., Monsoon from June to September), and yearly aggregated rainfall figures.

Problem
India’s dependency on rainfall for agricultural productivity and water resource management necessitates a deep understanding of its temporal and spatial variability. This study aims to address critical questions regarding rainfall trends and their implications. The key objectives include analyzing historical rainfall data to uncover patterns and trends, detecting years or months with anomalous rainfall behavior, and exploring the relationships between seasonal and annual rainfall.

One of the primary goals is to investigate the impact of climate change on India’s rainfall patterns. Are there discernible shifts in annual or seasonal rainfall due to changing climatic conditions? Additionally, identifying drought years or periods of extreme rainfall can help policymakers and stakeholders prepare for potential adverse events.
