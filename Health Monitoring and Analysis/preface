The given dataset contains several health-related metrics for different patients, organized in the following columns:

PatientID: Numerical identifier for the patient.
Age: Age of the patient in years.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.
BloodPressure: Blood pressure readings, formatted inconsistently.
RespiratoryRate: Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.
BodyTemperature: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.
ActivityLevel: Activity level at the time of the measurement.
OxygenSaturation: Oxygen saturation percentage.
SleepQuality: Quality of sleep reported by the patient.
StressLevel: Reported level of stress.
Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.
The dataset includes health metrics from 500 individuals, featuring variables such as age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation, recorded over a specific period. These variables provide a comprehensive snapshot of each patientâ€™s health status, which is crucial for monitoring and managing various health conditions.

Problem:
Traditional health monitoring systems often categorize patient health status using rigid, predefined thresholds that may not capture the nuanced variations across a diverse patient population. This can lead to oversimplified assessments and potentially overlook subtle yet critical patterns in health data. The challenge is to develop a more dynamic and responsive approach that utilizes unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings within health data, facilitating personalized and precise health management.

Expected Outcomes:
Identified Clusters: Distinct patient groups based on health metrics, each with unique characteristics that provide insight into their specific health needs.
Personalized Health Insights: Enhanced understanding of patient health requirements and risks, enabling tailored intervention strategies.
Improved Health Monitoring: Recommendations for targeted monitoring and intervention strategies that cater to the specific needs of each cluster, leading to more effective health management and better patient outcomes.
