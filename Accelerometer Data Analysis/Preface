Accelerometer is a device used to measure the acceleration or vibrations of a motion. The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring.

Dataset Information:
Below are all the features in the dataset:

Date: The date on which the activity was recorded. 
Time: The time of day when the activity was recorded. 
accel_x, accel_y, accel_z: The x, y, and z axis values of the accelerometer data, which measures the acceleration in m/s^2.
You can use this dataset for Accelerometer Data Analysis.
