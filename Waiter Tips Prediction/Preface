Tipping waiters for serving food depends on many factors like the type of restaurant, how many people you are with, how much amount you pay as your bill, etc. Waiter Tips analysis is one of the popular data science case studies where we need to predict the tips given to a waiter for serving the food in a restaurant.

The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. The data recorded by the food server is as follows:

total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes
tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars
sex: gender of the person paying the bill
smoker: whether the person smoked or not
day: day of the week
time: lunch or dinner
size: number of people in a table 
So this is the data recorded by the restaurant. Based on this data, our task is to find the factors affecting waiter tips and train a machine learning model to predict the waiterâ€™s tipping.
