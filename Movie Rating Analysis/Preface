Analyzing the rating given by viewers of a movie helps many people decide whether or not to watch that movie. So, for the Movie Rating Analysis task, you first need to have a dataset that contains data about the ratings given by each viewer. For this task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle that contains two files:

one file contains the data about the movie Id, title and the genre of the movie 
and the other file contains the user id, movie id, ratings given by the user and the timestamp of the ratings
