User funnel analysis is a way to understand how users interact with a website or an application. It helps businesses analyze the conversion rate from the page the user visited the website or the app to the page user left the website or the app.

By tracking user flow as they move through the various stages of the funnel, companies can identify areas where users are giving up or getting stuck, then take action to improve user experience and increase conversions.

For example, if a lot of users leave the website after adding items to the cart, the company may look for ways to make the checkout process faster and easier.

Dataset information:
Analyzing user funnels involves collecting and analyzing data related to user behaviour and actions at each stage of the funnel to understand how users progress through the different stages, and where they give up or exit.

Here’s a dataset we collected from an e-commerce platform based on the flow of users on their platform. Below are all the features in the dataset:

user_id: represents unique user identifiers
stage: represents the stage of the user’s journey through the funnel 
conversion: indicates whether the user has converted or not
Your task is to analyze user funnel data to understand the conversion journey of users. Identify the stages where users give up the most and the least. Are there specific stages where users tend to convert more frequently or less frequently? Provide visualizations and information to support your conclusions.
